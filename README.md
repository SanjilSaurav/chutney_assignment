# Black Jack Game
## Rules for playing this game
For those who have never played blackjack before, we’ll give you a quick rundown of the rules. Blackjack’s magical number is 21. When the total value of all the cards dealt to a player surpasses 21, the player goes bust and loses immediately.

A player wins against the dealer if he or she gets an exact 21. Otherwise, the amount of the player’s cards must be more than the sum of the dealer’s cards in order to win.

Each face card has a fixed value of ten, but the ace can be counted as one or eleven, depending on the player’s chances of winning. The worth of the remaining cards is determined by their quantity.
